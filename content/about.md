Hello,

I'm Curtis, a full stack developer primarily focused on cloud security.
Since the start of my professional career in 2018, I have been vigorously learning about what it means to secure the cloud.
I've been on a security team who's objective is the prevention, detection, notification, remediation, and training of security misconfiguration of AWS resources.
Wow, that's a mouthful.
 
Aside from my attention on AWS, I want to understand the DevSecOps environment and how it can be improved.
Because of this, I have experience in infrastructure as code (IaC) through terraform, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) though gitlab/gitops, managing docker images/containers through kubernetes clusters, and others with more to come.

I strive to continuously learn, teach, and collaborate with developers to help promote a stronger DevSecOps practice. 

Thanks for reading!
