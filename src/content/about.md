Hello,

I’m Curtis, a full-stack engineer focused on everything cloud-related.

I started my professional career in 2018, when I had to vigorously learn about what it meant to operate and secure operations in the cloud. I started within a security team whose objective was to prevent, detect, notify, remediate, investigate, and educate others in relation to security misconfiguration of AWS resources. Wow, that's a mouthful.

Since then, I've expanded beyond only focusing on security in the cloud to the broader landscape of anything and everything cloud related. I enjoy learning about new services or new ways existing services are reenvisioned. An demonstration of this is over in my [blog posts](/posts) where I tackle some fun weekend projects.

Aside from my attention on cloud, I want to understand the DevSecOps environment and how it can be improved.
Because of this, I continuously learn new techniques in infrastructure as code (IaC) through Terraform, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) though GitLab/GitHub/Gitops, managing container images/container runtimes through Kubernetes clusters, and more. Beyond the tools, I strive to continuously learn, mentor, and collaborate with other engineers to continuously promote stronger DevSecOps practices. 

Thanks for reading!
