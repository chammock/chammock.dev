TF Mirror came about as a weekend project to further understand the internal workings of the Terraform [provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/provider-registry-protocol) and [module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/module-registry-protocol) registry protocols, along with the Terraform [Network Provider Mirror](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/provider-network-mirror-protocol) protocol. TF Mirror should work for both Haashicorp Terraform and OpenTofu. To learn about TF Mirror, or how to use it, checkout the TF Mirror website ([tfmirror.dev](https://tfmirror.dev)) or the [GitHub project](https://github.com/chammock/tfmirror).
